You will then navigate to the top panel in which you may select an input unit from the combo box. Then type your unit amount in the text field located underneath the input combo box. Then select the output unit located in the middle of the GUI frame. Click the 'Calculate' button, and your converted output amount will be displayed in the bottom panel.
